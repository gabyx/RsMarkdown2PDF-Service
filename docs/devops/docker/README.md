# Nesting Containers with Podman

Run

```shell
name=ttl.sh/podman-test
podman build -f Containerfile -t "$name" --target original .
podman push "$name"

podman run --privileged --rm -it "$name" ./run.sh
```

to see that we can build `Containerfile` (`podman` engine) then execute the
built container and inside call `./run.sh` again which recursively nests
containers. You can also use
`podman build -f Containerfile -t "$name" --target own .` to use an alpine
podman image with the same issues.

Its just too cool that this works? ðŸ¤£

Up to 3 nested containers it works until then something crashes when setting up
new user namespaces. How to resolve it, no idea.
